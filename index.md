# About me
My name is Chengkai Yang. I have almost **9 years of work experience** in big data development and back-end development in the fields of autonomous driving, finance, and banking.

I am currently pursuing a master degree in **[Applied Data Science](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/future/mads/index.php)** at the University of Victoria.

I believe that my past engineering background and the data science I am currently studying can help me solve problems more effectively in the future.

# Skills

I use Java, Scala and Python, as well as the following technology stack.

- JVM/Python Tuning tools: Jprofile, Arthas ,Eclipse MAT, pdb, Py-Spy
- Big Data tools: Spark, Flink, HBase, Hadoop, etc.
- Data Warehouse Development: Hive, PrestoSQL, Oracle, Impala
- Backend development: Spring framework
- Data collect and analyis: Pandas, Scrapy. 

# Project

Here is an **[short video of a Flink project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCqqfJ_6T3s)** I did previously using Flink to process log to find potential bugs in real-time

# Employment History

## Senior Data Engineer - [Neolix Autonomous Vechile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDfZvybUgSo) 

Apr 2023 - Dec 2024  Beijing,China

Used HBase, Spark and Flink analyzing the trajectory of autonomous vehicle data  (TB-scale daily) to assess the performance of the vehicle. 

Participated in building an image annotation platform (Using Spring Framework) to help the algorithm team manage and store datasets, to train the algorithm more efficiently.

# Learning

The courses that I am currently studying or planning to study in MADS at the University of Victoria include:

- [Systems for Massive Datasets](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/grad/index.php#/courses/view/5cbdf5302a310a240068a521): The reason why I chose this course is that it teaches how to use frameworks such as Spark to run algorithms like ML on large datasets to solve problems.

- [Introduction to Parallel and Cluster Computing](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/grad/#/courses/view/6082f54cee26e2319b887a4e): I have used several parallel computing frameworks such as Spark and MapReduce. This course will specifically cover the design principles of parallel computing.

Other courses of MADS mainly include Machine Learning, which is also a topic that I am very interested in. See the [link](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/future/mads/our-program/index.php) for details.

# Contributions to the open-source project Apache Flink

I am also a **contributor** to the community of the well-known real-time processing framework [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/).

 My contributions mainly include [translating the official English documentation of Flink into Chinese](https://github.com/apache/flink/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Achengkaiyang2025+is%3Aclosed), which helps thousands of Chinese developers use Flink better. Here is a main list of my contributions.

- [Translate "Metric Reporters" page of "Deployment"](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/19496/files)
This article mainly introduces how to use monitoring tools such as Prometheus and JMX to better monitor the running status of Flink.

- [Translate "Extension Points" and "Full Stack Example" in "User-defined Sources & Sinks" page](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20331/files):This article mainly introduces how users can customize the Table API to read and write data to external storage in addition to the Table connectors provided by Flink officially (such as Kafka connector, JDBC connector).

# Fun facts about me

I really enjoy doing weight training at the gym. 

I believe that long-term physical exercise can improve my concentration and perseverance. 

Currently, I train at the [gym of the University of Victoria](https://vikesrec.ca/), and it is also a great place to meet new friends and train together.
