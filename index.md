# About me

I have almost 9 years of work experience in big data development and back-end development in the fields of autonomous driving, finance, and banking.

During this process, I realized that when dealing with and analyzing vast amounts of data, simply using SQL or traditional data analysis methods is not very productive. Many problems need technologies such as machine learning or deep learning to be effectively solved. 

So I applied the [MADS program](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/future/mads/index.php) at the University of Victoria to learn more about data science, and Now I'm back to the unversity again! 

I believe that can improve my abilities in data processing and analysis and use machine learning and other methods to solve massive data problems in a better way.


# Skills

# Learning

# Projects

Big data management: Responsible for the storage management of different data types. For example, using object storage such as MinIO to manage images of the training datasets, and designing a client program that supports users to upload images to the dataset using the aws S3 protocol. Using Elasticsearch and HBase to store TB-scale trajectory point data, supporting backend services to query data at millisecond-level.
